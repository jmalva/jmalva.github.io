Recent Graduate from the University of California, San Diego. Where I earned my B.S. in Computer Engineering. ðŸ¥³

Fun(?) Facts:

I'm the first in my extended family to graduate from college.

The weirdest class I took was "Beauty and the Brain", where I wrote my final essay on Megan Fox.

My favorite meal combination of 2018 was soon-doo-boo and special fried chicken wings.

More to come...
